How To Use HebreWords
----------------------

When creating a word, separate a LETTER from a VOWEL using "|".
If a letter has NO vowel, don't put anything after the "|".
Then, separate SYLLABLES from one another using a space.
The codes for letters and vowels are case sensitive.
All things must be categorized (if saved) as a noun, verb, or adjective.

M = Mem
N = Nun
S = Samech
Ay = Ayin
P = Pey
F = Fed
Tz = Tzadee
K = Koof
R = Resh
Sh = Shin
Si = Sin
T = Tav

a = line vowel
ah = tee vowel
. = silent (two stacked dots) vowel
oh = dot upper left vowel
e = three dot "eh" vowel
eh = five dot "eh" vowel
